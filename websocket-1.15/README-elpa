1 Description
═════════════

  This is a elisp library for websocket clients to talk to websocket
  servers, and for websocket servers to accept connections from
  websocket clients. This library is designed to be used by other
  library writers, to write apps that use websockets, and is not useful
  by itself.

  An example of how to use the library is in the
  [websocket-functional-test.el] file.

  This library is compatible with emacs 23 and 24, although only emacs
  24 support secure websockets.
